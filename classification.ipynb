From the above 5 examples, it seems like its good at classifying `Direct advice`, `Resource suggestion`, `Empathetic responses`. However, it is inaccurate when it comes to `Diagnosis` or `Treatment`. OpenAI will most likely be alot more accurate but it is not free. Due to the time constraint, and low cost of classification using OpenAI, it seems like the most reasonable move. There is a chance that OPEN AI might hallucinate or give undesirable results. But overall it is the least time-consuming option and the trade-off is worth it. Additionally, the labels could be useful in training a supervised machine learning algorithm in the future and using that to classify instead of making API calls to OpenAI",
