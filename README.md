# TheraPal

## Overview
A modern companion for therapists and counsellors to use when they need guidance on how to best help a patient. 

This application is a preliminary version, a "proof of concept," demonstrating the core idea or functionality. It's not intended for full-scale production use, as the production version will be significantly different in terms of features, robustness, and scaling.
